# Vehicle Image Classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Values of Confusion_Marix and Accuracy_Score vary each time you run your code.
* Download a set of images of cars and bikes and save them differently in unique folder. Save those folders in a parent folder.
* Create a dataframe by iterating over the image.
* from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split & from sklearn.svm import SVC
* Fit the model
* Calculate Confusion_Matrix and Accuracy_Score.
* Testing a new image.
